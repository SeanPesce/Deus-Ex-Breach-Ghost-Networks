# Deus Ex: Breach Ghost Networks  

This repository serves as an archive of all official [Deus Ex: Breach](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555450/) daily Ghost Networks since the day the feature was released ([2017-07-14](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-breach-launches-random-daily-networks)).  

Note that the JSON data has been left in the original format provided by the real-world upstream server; it has not been beautified. This is because the JSON parser in the game is finicky and will sometimes fail to parse the data if the formatting is changed.  To beautify JSON data, use a tool such as [CodeBeautify.org](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer)  or use Python from the command line:  

```
python -m json.tool 2017-02-14.json
```  

## Missing Ghost Networks  

Ghost Networks were (seemingly) never generated by Eidos/Square Enix for the following date ranges (a total of 27 days):  

 * [2020-08-11, 2020-08-26]  
 * [2020-11-19, 2020-11-23]  
 * [2020-12-01, 2020-12-06]  

Evidence that the missing networks were likely never created can be found in the following posts on social media:

 * [August/November 2020](https://steamcommunity.com/app/337000/discussions/0/3862353324242873119/)  
 * [August/December 2020](https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/93516-when-do-breach-ghost-nodes-decrypt/)  
 * [November 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/jzvrn3/dxmd_breach_offline_again/)  

Note also that the Ghost Networks on the first day after each missing range were created on the same day they were published (2020-08-27, 2020-11-24, and 2020-12-07).
