# Deus Ex: Breach Ghost Networks  

This repository serves as an archive of all official [Deus Ex: Breach](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555450/) daily Ghost Networks since the day the feature was released ([2017-07-14](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-breach-launches-random-daily-networks)).  


## Missing Ghost Networks  

Ghost Networks were (seemingly) never generated by Eidos/Square Enix for the following date ranges (a total of 27 days):  

 * [2020-08-11, 2020-08-26]  
 * [2020-11-19, 2020-11-23]  
 * [2020-12-01, 2020-12-06]  

Evidence that the missing networks were likely never created can be found in the following posts on social media:

 * [August/November 2020](https://steamcommunity.com/app/337000/discussions/0/3862353324242873119/)  
 * [August/December 2020](https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/93516-when-do-breach-ghost-nodes-decrypt/)  
 * [November 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/jzvrn3/dxmd_breach_offline_again/)  

Note also that the Ghost Networks on the first day after each missing range were created on the same day they were published (2020-08-27, 2020-11-24, and 2020-12-07).
